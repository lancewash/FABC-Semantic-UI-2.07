<h2>The historic First African Baptist Church</h2>
                    <p>The historic First African Baptist Church, which stands today on the corner of Clifton and
                        Laurel Avenue in Darby Township, was birthed into existence as a result of a vision of two
                        committed saints, Sister Louisa Spain and Sister Eliza Taylor. The two met and formulated
                        plans to establish a Township Mission in 1902. The first service was held in the kitchen of
                        Sister Spain’s home. Along with nine other souls, they organized a Baptist Fellowship and in
                        1903 they moved into the first building at Hermesprota Creek, where the Reverend J. B.
                        Brandon served as the first Pastor. In July of 1904, the church was given the name First
                        African Baptist Church. </p>

                        <h3>And the Lord blessed the House:</h3>

                        <p>The dream continued and in 1909, Rev. C. T. Wilcher was the leading spirit and under his
                            pastorate First African Baptist Church was incorporated as required by the Commonwealth of
                            Pennsylvania. Its stated purpose was to provide for the public worship of Almighty God
                            according to Baptist doctrine and the principles as set forth by God’s Holy Word. Reverend
                            Allen, Reverend W. E. Scott and Reverend J. Lincoln succeeded Reverend Wilcher. <br/></p>

                        <h3>And the Lord blessed His House:</h3>

                        <p>After a few years of being without a Pastor, the church called Reverend Booker W. Watkins to
                            be the undershepherd. He began his tenure in April, 1936 and he served faithfully and
                            tirelessly for forty years. During this period, the church grew and continued to be a
                            spiritual refuge in the community. The mortgage was burned and a parsonage was constructed.
                            As a testament to the growing congregation many organizations were formed. Included were the
                            Willing Workers, the Nurses Unit, The Rose of Sharon Missionary Circle, the Heart in Hand,
                            the Flower Club, the Hospitality Club, the Senior Usher's, the Pastor’s Aide, the Choir #2,
                            the Young Adult Choir, the Junior Choir, the Church School and Vacation Bible School. In
                            1971, a new edifice was completed. Pastor Watkins and the congregation worshiped for the
                            first time, in the new church on April 25, 1971. After years of loving and committed
                            service, Pastor Watkins went home to be with the Lord in March of 1976. <br/></p>

                        <h3>And the Lord blessed His House:</h3>

                        <p>After the death of Reverend Watkins, Reverend Charles Cunningham served as interim Pastor.
                            Reverend Jerry William Dailey assumed the pastorate in October 1977. During this time, many
                            innovative changes were implemented. Members were led to begin tithing. A Federal Credit
                            Union was established. The B.W Watkins Memorial Scholarship Fund for high school graduates
                            was initiated and the transportation ministry began. Reverend Dailey was called to another
                            pastorate in 1982. Reverend Fredrick Randolph served as interim pastor from 1982 – 1985.
                            <br/></p>

                        <h3>And the Lord blessed His House:</h3>

                        <p>In 1985, Reverend Dr. Richard A. Dent was called to lead the church. Following the vision
                            given to him, Reverend Dent was able to bring about a spiritual and physical renaissance.
                            Church membership and attendance increased dramatically, church facilities were renovated,
                            and the mortgage was burned. The ordination of deacons, trustees and our first female
                            minister the Reverend Margaret Quarcoo took place. A full service transportation ministry
                            was implemented consisting of three vans, one of which is equipped to service the physically
                            challenged and a forty-passenger bus. In obedience to the mandates of the Lord, Pastor Dent
                            began to change the clubs and auxiliaries into ministries. This transformation enabled the
                            church to reach into the community and provide much needed services. Out of these efforts,
                            the Neighbor to Neighbor Community Development Corporation came into existence. The services
                            presently in place are the Emergency Food Cupboard, After-School Tutoring, the After-School
                            Care Program, and Camp Joy summer day camp.</p>

                        <p>The renewal of God’s people continues through the formation of additional active ministries,
                            both in-reach and outreach. Some of which are the Men’s Ministry, the Women’s Ministry, the
                            Prison Ministry, the Chosen 300 (help for the homeless), the Caring Ministry, visitation to
                            the Juvenile Detention Center and to a Women’s Shelter and several youth programs are in
                            place to minister to our large number of young people.</p>

                        <p>Continuing with the vision, the Nehemiah Project was launched for the building of a new
                            edifice to accommodate the continued growth of the Lord’s house. On the tenth day of January
                            2004 Pastor Dent and the officers joyfully led the congregation into its new sanctuary where
                            we continue to worship and praise a living Savior.<br/></p>
